     <p>How it works?</p>
   <p>Lightning Network is a cutting-edge technology at Layer 2 designed to solve the scalability, processing speed, and fees associated with Bitcoin's blockchain. By executing transactions outside of the blockchain (off-chain), it is possible to significantly improve the speed of money transfers and lower transfer fees for small-value payments.
<hr />     
      Qubit Chain is researching the use of quantum computers to further speed up the Lightning network. We are speeding up the process as a root search problem for a machine called a special annealing machine. Please see Research Paper for more details.

   <p>
    By having users do the staking, the company plans to share a portion of the profits generated by the operation of its quantum computer. That is what this staking page is all about. The Lightning Network pays a certain amount of compensation to network participants, and this page will distribute that compensation.
    <hr />     
    The buttons in the leftmost column define various actions and also provide related information. Check them out if you want to know more about Lightning. As for staking rewards, it is difficult to state percentages as they fluctuate in real time, so always check the values.
